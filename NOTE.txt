List of API calls we try to whitelist to allow the attacker to 
naively reduce the frequency of (i.e., just remove without care):

Allow: we whitelist these
    4137: Sleep
        - We can reduce this because sleeping doesn't necessarily affect the malicious
          behavior
    836: CreateMutexA 
        - We can reduce this because CreateMutexA doesn't necessarily affect the malicious
          behavior

    1604: FindClose 
        - We can reduce this because CreateMutexA doesn't necessarily affect the malicious
          behavior
    
    1591: FileTimeToDosDateTime
        - We can reduce this because CreateMutexA doesn't necessarily affect the malicious
          behavior
    2035: GetModuleHandleExA
        - We can reduce this because CreateMutexA doesn't necessarily affect the malicious
          behavior
    1592: FileTimeToLocalFileTime
        - We can reduce this because CreateMutexA doesn't necessarily affect the malicious
          behavior

    1616: FindFirstFileA
        - We can reduce this because CreateMutexA doesn't necessarily affect the malicious
          behavior
Disallow: we chose not to whitelist these
    4673: WriteFile
        - We chose not to reduce this because it can affect the malicious behaviors.
          Maybe, though, we can consolidate WriteFile() calls?
    1929: GetFileType
	- We chose not ot reduce this because it can affect the malicious behaviors.
    3107: ReadFile
	- We chose not ot reduce this because it can affect the malicious behaviors.
    2217: GetSystemDirectoryA
